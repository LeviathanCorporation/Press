# The LC Manifesto

1. Human suffering in any form should be avoided at any cost.
2. Technological innovation should always strive for -and not come at the expense of- human quality of life.
3. Preserving an individual's ability to survive comfortably is neither socialist nor philanthropic, it is the bare minimum.
4. Businesses should have no concern with the gender identity, sexuality, romantic orientation, race, or ethicity of their employees, nor their customers.
5. Individuals should not have to fight simply to keep food & water on the table for themselves and their loved ones.
